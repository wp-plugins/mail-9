Mail 9 manages your mail queue.

== Description ==

When you send hundreds of mail at a time, this plugin would be a great help. Once you activate Mail 9, it throws all mail into a "mail queue" managed on database. The mail in the queue are dequeued little by little (ten mail per minute by default) to be sent actually. In this way, you can avoid bursting your mail server.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `mail-9` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

You can see the mail queue status in Tools > Mail Queue menu. Also, several settings are in Settings > General menu.
